# H3Porting
Here you can find cmds files for porting halo 3 content. Feel free to upload your own cmds files for other content or apply fixes to currently existing cmds files.

### Make sure you run the PrePorting Fixes script before any porting.
#### If you are running a build with ported maps, don't run fixes3.cmds
